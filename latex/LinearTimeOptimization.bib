  Abstract                 = {Abstract We explore the notion of a Well-spaced Blue-noise Distribution (WBD) of points, which combines two desirable properties. First, the point distribution is random, as measured by its spectrum having blue noise. Second, it is well-spaced in the sense that the minimum separation distance between samples is large compared to the maximum coverage distance between a domain point and a sample, i.e. its Voronoi cell aspect ratios 2 β i are small. It is well known that maximizing one of these properties destroys the other: uniform random points have no aspect ratio bound, and the vertices of an equilateral triangular tiling have no randomness. However, we show that there is a lot of room in the middle to get good values for both. Maximal Poisson-disk sampling provides β = 1 and blue noise. We show that a standard optimization technique can improve the well-spacedness while preserving randomness. Given a random point set, our Opt- β i algorithm iterates over the points, and for each point locally optimizes its Voronoi cell aspect ratio 2 β i . It can improve β i to a large fraction of the theoretical bound given by a structured tiling: improving from 1.0 to around 0.8, about half-way to 0.58, while preserving most of the randomness of the original set. In terms of both β and randomness, the output of Opt- β i compares favorably to alternative point improvement techniques, such as centroidal Voronoi tessellation with a constant density function, which do not target β directly. We demonstrate the usefulness of our output through meshing and filtering applications. An open problem is constructing from scratch a \{WBD\} distribution with a guarantee of β &lt; 1 . },

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a new global approach for image dithering, stippling, screening and sampling. It is inspired by the physical principles of electrostatics. Repelling forces between equally charged particles create a homogeneous distribution in flat areas, while attracting forces from the image brightness values ensure a high approximation quality. Our model is transparent and uses only two intuitive parameters: One steers the granularity of our halftoning approach, and the other its regularity. We evaluate two versions of our algorithm: A discrete version for dithering that ties points to grid positions, as well as a continuous one which does not have this restriction, and can thus be used for stippling or sampling density functions. Our methods create very few visual artefacts, reveal favourable blue-noise behaviour in the frequency domain, and have a lower approximation error under Gaussian convolution than state-of-the-art methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital halftoning, also referred to as spatial dithering is a method of rendering the illusion of continuous-tone pictures on displays that are capable of only producing binary picture elements. The concept of blue noise-high-frequency white noise-is introduced and found to have desirable properties for halftoning. Efficient algorithms for dithering with blue noise, based on perturbed error diffusion, are developed. The nature of dither patterns produced is extensively examined in the frequency domain. Metrics for analyzing the frequency content of aperiodic patterns for both rectangular and hexagonal grids are developed; blue-noise dithering is found to be ideally suited for rectangular grids. Several carefully selected digitally produced examples are included},

  Abstract                 = {Sample point distributions possessing blue noise spectral characteristics play a central role in computer graphics, but are notoriously difficult to generate. We describe an algorithm to very efficiently generate these distributions. The core idea behind our method is to compute a Capacity-Constrained Delaunay Triangulation (CCDT), namely, given a simple polygon P in the plane, and the desired number of points n, compute a Delaunay triangulation of the interior of P with n Steiner points, whose triangles have areas which are as uniform as possible. This is computed iteratively by alternating update of the point geometry and triangulation connectivity. The vertex set of the \{CCDT\} is shown to have good blue noise characteristics, comparable in quality to those of state-of-the-art methods, achieved at a fraction of the runtime. Our \{CCDT\} method may be applied also to an arbitrary density function to produce non-uniform point distributions. These may be used to half-tone grayscale images. },

abstract = {We generalize and improve earlier constructions of low-discrepancy sequences by Sobol', Faure, and the author, thus obtaining sequences in the s-dimensional unit cube with the smallest discrepancy that is currently known. The construction is based on the theory of (t, s)-sequences. It is also shown that the dispersion of the sequences constructed here has the smallest possible order of magnitude among any sequences in the s-dimensional unit cube.},
